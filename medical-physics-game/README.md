# Medical Physics Game

A roguelike educational game for learning medical physics concepts.

## Overview

This project is an educational game designed to teach medical physics concepts through engaging gameplay. By combining roguelike game mechanics with carefully crafted educational content, the game provides an interactive learning experience for students and professionals in the medical physics field.

## Features

- **Skill Tree System**: Progressive learning path for building knowledge
- **Question System**: Educational questions integrated into gameplay
- **Patient Case Studies**: Real-world applications of medical physics concepts
- **Procedural Map Generation**: Unique gameplay experiences each time
- **Node-Based Progression**: Diverse encounter types to maintain engagement

## Educational Value

This game addresses the challenge of making medical physics concepts engaging and accessible. By contextualizing learning within gameplay, it helps students:

1. Understand core physics principles applied to medicine
2. Practice decision-making in simulated clinical scenarios
3. Build knowledge progressively through the skill tree system
4. Engage with content through interactive challenges

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation between systems. See [SYSTEMS.md](docs/SYSTEMS.md) for detailed documentation of the system architecture.
